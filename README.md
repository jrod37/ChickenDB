# ChickenDB
Literally me learning SQL using... well... chickens!

I am learning SQL from a book called Beginning
Database Design Solutions by Rod Stephens. So far it's an easy read and a fun introduction into the topic. I also just started my career centered around database administration so I want to up my skills using this exercise. Should be fun!
